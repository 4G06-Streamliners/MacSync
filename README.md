**Large Event Management Platform for MES**  

## Project Overview  
 The McMaster Engineering Society (MES) holds various large events throughout the year that are attended by several hundred students, such as the Fireball Formal, Graduation Formal, and Pub Nights. The goal for this project would be to develop a platform to streamline the registration, waiver, and check-in processes for these events, reducing the administrative burden for the student volunteers organizing the event and a smoother experience for those attending.



## Key Features (Planned)  
- 🎟️ **Ticket Sales & Registration** – Secure and simple event signup  
- 🚌 **Table & Bus Signups** – Easy coordination for groups and transportation 
- 🎶 **Song Requests** – Pre-event engagement for socials/formals  
- 📸 **Photo Gallery** – Centralized media sharing post-event  
- ⏳ **Waitlists** – Automated management of capacity-limited events  
- 📊 **Admin Dashboards** – Analytics and simplified volunteer workflows  
- 🔔 **Push Notifications & Reminders** – Increase memorability and attendance  
- 📅 **Centralized Event Hub** – One place for all MES events
