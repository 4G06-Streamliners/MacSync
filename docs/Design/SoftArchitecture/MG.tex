\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucTechStack}:] 
The system's technology stack (Next.js/React frontend, NestJS backend, PostgreSQL database) 
is a stable decision and unlikely to change during or after development.
Altering this foundation would require complete re-architecture.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucHosting}:] 
Hosting on DigitalOcean and database management using PostgreSQL containers 
are fixed infrastructure decisions.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucPrivacy}:] 
Compliance with PIPEDA and McMaster University privacy policies is a permanent 
requirement that will not change. Any change would necessitate legal
review and cross-module rewriting.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucRolesArch}:] 
Security protocols such as TLS 1.3, AES-256 encryption, audit logging, and 
fail-safe defaults are core safety standards defined in the Hazard Analysis
and are not expected to change.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucRolesArch}:] 
The role hierarchy (Attendee, Organizer, Executive) and three-tier architecture 
(frontend, backend, database) are foundational and not expected to evolve.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucScope}:] 
The system scope will remain focused on MES event management. Expansion to unrelated 
domains (e.g., general club management or social networking) is not anticipated.

\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\subsection*{User Interface Modules}

\begin{description}
\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M1}
\item [M\themnum: Payment Processing Module] Handles the logic and communication between
the frontend and backend services for processing event payments and verifying
transactions.

\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M2}
\item [M\themnum: RBAC/FBAC Access Control Module] Manages user permissions and determines
which features are accessible to each user role within the mobile and web
applications. This module relies on the User Authorization Module for user
authentication and identity verification.

\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M3}
\item [M\themnum: Sign-Up Module] Provides functionality for participants to register for
different event activities. It contains shared logic for registration flows,
along with specific submodules for each type of sign-up.
\renewcommand{\thesubmnum}{\themnum.\arabic{submnum}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [\refstepcounter{submnum}\label{M3.1}\textbf{M\thesubmnum:}] \textbf{Bus Sign-Up Module} Handles registration for bus
    transportation, including capacity validation and seat allocation.
    \item [\refstepcounter{submnum}\label{M3.2}\textbf{M\thesubmnum:}] \textbf{Table Sign-Up Module} Manages registration and table
    assignments for group events.
    \item [\refstepcounter{submnum}\label{M3.3}\textbf{M\thesubmnum:}] \textbf{RSVP Sign-Up Module} Handles RSVP submissions and
    confirmation tracking for events.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsection*{Backend Modules}

\begin{description}
\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M4}
\item [M\themnum: Payment Configuration Module] Stores and manages payment parameters such
as currency, and API integration details for supported payment
methods.

\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M5}
\item [M\themnum: Access Control Module] Implements backend logic for role-based and
feature-based permissions, ensuring consistent authorization across the system.

\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M6}
\item [M\themnum: Registration Rules Module] Defines and enforces sign-up policies,
including event deadlines, capacity limits, and participant prioritization
criteria.

\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M7}
\item [M\themnum: Notification Handling Module] Manages the delivery of notifications to
users across different parts of the system. It coordinates sending confirmations,
updates, and reminders related to payments and registrations. This module ensures
that users receive timely and relevant information through email or in-app alerts.

\refstepcounter{mnum}\label{M8}
\item [M\themnum: User Authorization Module] Handles user authentication, login, and
session management. It verifies user credentials, and
provides identity data to other modules such as RBAC/FBAC and Payment Processing.
This module serves as the foundation for all user-based operations within the system.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules (\mref{mHH})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The data structure and algorithm used to implement the virtual
  hardware.
\item[Services:]Serves as a virtual hardware used by the rest of the
  system. This module provides the interface between the hardware and the
  software. So, the system can use it to display outputs or to accept inputs.
\item[Implemented By:] OS
\end{description}

\subsection{Behaviour-Hiding Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The contents of the required behaviours.
\item[Services:]Includes programs that provide externally visible behaviour of
  the system as specified in the software requirements specification (SRS)
  documents. This module serves as a communication layer between the
  hardware-hiding module and the software decision module. The programs in this
  module will need to change if there are changes in the SRS.
\item[Implemented By:] --
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Input Format Module (\mref{mInput})}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:]The format and structure of the input data.
\item[Services:]Converts the input data into the data structure used by the
  input parameters module.
\item[Implemented By:] [Your Program Name Here]
\item[Type of Module:] [Record, Library, Abstract Object, or Abstract Data Type]
  [Information to include for leaf modules in the decomposition by secrets tree.]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Etc.}


\subsection{Software Decision Module}

\begin{description}
\item[Secrets:] The design decision based on mathematical theorems, physical
  facts, or programming considerations. The secrets of this module are
  \emph{not} described in the SRS.
\item[Services:] Includes data structure and algorithms used in the system that
  do not provide direct interaction with the user. 
  % Changes in these modules are more likely to be motivated by a desire to
  % improve performance than by externally imposed changes.
\item[Implemented By:] --
\end{description}

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\wss{The uses relation is not a data flow diagram.  In the code there will often
be an import statement in module A when it directly uses module B.  Module B
provides the services that module A needs.  The code for module A needs to be
able to see these services (hence the import statement).  Since the uses
relation is transitive, there is a use relation without an import, but the
arrows in the diagram typically correspond to the presence of import statement.}

\wss{If module A uses module B, the arrow is directed from A to B.}
