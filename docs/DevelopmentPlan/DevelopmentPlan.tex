\section{Confidential Information?}

This project does not involve the use or disclosure of confidential information 
from any industry partner. All requirements, specifications, and implementation 
details have been developed by the student team. As there is no industry-provided proprietary data 
or trade secrets involved, no Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is required. 

\section{IP to Protect}

All intellectual property (IP) generated as part of this project is owned by the 
student team, in accordance with McMaster Universityâ€™s policies on ownership of 
student work. Since the project is not sponsored by an external industry partner, 
no Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement form is required. To enable the 
intended use of the system, the student team will grant the McMaster Engineering 
Society a non-exclusive license to operate and maintain the software for its 
events and activities. Ownership of the underlying source code remains with the 
student developers. 

\section{Copyright License}

All software developed by the student team is protected under copyright law. 
To clarify permitted use, the team has adopted the MIT License, which is included 
in the project repository
\href{https://github.com/4G06-Streamliners/demo-repository/blob/main/LICENSE}{here}. 
This license allows reuse and modification of the code, provided that the 
original copyright notice and license terms are preserved. This ensures proper 
attribution to the development team.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\subsubsection*{Languages \& Frameworks} 
The team will use \textbf{JavaScript} as the primary language across the stack. 
The web application will be built with \textbf{Next.js (React)}, the mobile application with \textbf{React Native}, 
and the backend will be developed using \textbf{NestJS} (chosen for its opinionated structure atop Express).

\subsubsection*{Database \& ORM} 
The database will be \textbf{PostgreSQL}, self-managed via a Docker container. 
For database access, the team is considering \textbf{Drizzle ORM} as the shared standard across groups.

\subsubsection*{Payments} 
Payments will be handled through \textbf{Stripe}, integrated using official SDKs. 
Processor-specific logic will be isolated within the backend service.

\subsubsection*{Selected Libraries (initial)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Frontend:} a React component library (e.g., Tailwind or Material UI) to accelerate UI development.
  \item \textbf{Backend:} NestJS modules for routing/validation; Stripe SDK for payments; Drizzle ORM for database access.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Custom Components Expected to Be Implemented} 
Despite the existence of some libraries, the team anticipates implementing core logic to align with project requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Feature-Based Access Control (FBAC)} with role templates and per-user overrides.
  \item \textbf{Sign-up capacity/hold logic} (e.g., bus/table/RSVP) to safely manage contention and inventory.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Dev Workflow \& Tooling}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Git} for version control; \textbf{GitHub} for repository management; \textbf{GitHub Projects} for task tracking.
  \item Production hosting will be on \textbf{DigitalOcean} (school-hosted), with Postgres running in Docker.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Testing, CI/CD, and Performance} 
The team intends to adopt a layered testing strategy:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unit tests} for backend modules (NestJS services/controllers) and React components.
  \item \textbf{Integration tests} to validate backend endpoints against a local Postgres instance.
  \item \textbf{End-to-end (E2E) tests} for critical flows such as checkout, sign-ups, and access control.
\end{itemize}
Continuous Integration will be run through \textbf{GitHub Actions}, with pipelines for linting, type-checking, running automated tests, and validating database migrations.

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\newpage{}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\wss{borrows from
\href{https://engineering.up.edu/industry_partnerships/files/team-charter.pdf}
{University of Portland Team Charter}}

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding the quality
of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the
deliverables that members bring to the team?}

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

\wss{What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team
ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team
performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage
members whose performance is below expectations?  What are the consequences for
someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}

\subsubsection*{Team Building}

\wss{How will you build team cohesion (fun time, group rituals, etc.)? }

\subsubsection*{Decision Making} 

\wss{How will you make decisions in your group? Consensus?  Vote? How will you
handle disagreements? }
