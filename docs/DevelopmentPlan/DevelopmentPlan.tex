\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the

\section{Confidential Information?}

This project does not involve the use or disclosure of confidential information 
from any industry partner. All requirements, specifications, and implementation 
details have been developed by the student team. As there is no industry-provided proprietary data 
or trade secrets involved, no Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is required. 

\section{IP to Protect}

All intellectual property (IP) generated as part of this project is owned by the 
student team, in accordance with McMaster Universityâ€™s policies on ownership of 
student work. Since the project is not sponsored by an external industry partner, 
no Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement form is required. To enable the 
intended use of the system, the student team will grant the McMaster Engineering 
Society a non-exclusive license to operate and maintain the software for its 
events and activities. Ownership of the underlying source code remains with the 
student developers. 

\section{Copyright License}

All software developed by the student team is protected under copyright law. 
To clarify permitted use, the team has adopted the MIT License, which is included 
in the project repository
\href{https://github.com/4G06-team12-MacSync/demo-repository/blob/main/LICENSE}{here}. 
This license allows reuse and modification of the code, provided that the 
original copyright notice and license terms are preserved. This ensures proper 
attribution to the development team.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
\end{enumerate}

\newpage{}

\section*{Appendix --- Team Charter}

\subsection*{External Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure a grade of A+ in 4G06.
    \item Gain real-world experience in areas of project management, teamwork and shipping projects.
    \item Create a strong portfolio project that has a large user base and can be discussed in interviews.  
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All members are expected to attend all scheduled meetings either in-person or online.
    \item All members are expected to be on time for meetings and remain present for the duration of the meeting.
    \item All members are expected to notify the team 24 hours beforehand if they are unable to attend meetings.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}
Acceptable excuses for missing meetings or deadlines include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Family emergency
    \item Health issues
    \item Medical appointments
\end{itemize}
Unacceptable excuses for missing meetings or deadlines include the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forgetting about meetings
    \item Oversleeping
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the emergency affects the members ability to attend a meeting, they must notify the group immediately or as soon as possible after the emergency.
    \item If the emergency affects completion of work, the member must communicate explicitly what work is done and what remains so the team can decide on the division of labour or a plan to catch-up.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item All members must come to meetings prepared with progress updates on their tasks.
    \item Deliverables should be well-organized and reviewed before they are shared with the team.
    \item Contributions in the code repository must follow team standards for readability and documentation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Attitude}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All members must listen actively to all other members and avoid passive or dismissive behavior.
    \item All members should respect all ideas and viewpoints without judgment.
    \item All members are encouraged to share their ideas openly.
    \item All members must adopt a simple code of conduct revolving on principles of respect, communication and collaboration.
    \item Conflicts must be resolved respectfully and if unresolved will be escalated to the TA.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weekly progress check-ins where members discuss what they completed and next steps will be used to keep the team on track. 
    \item GitHub Issues and commits will be used to ensure members contribute as expected.
    
    \item Metrics: \begin{itemize}
        \item An attendance rate of 100\% is expected from all members unless an excuse is deemed valid and acceptable by the team.
        \item Consistent GitHub activity is expected per week with issues in progress or items being committed for review.
        \item On-time delivery of tasks on assigned deadlines.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Rewards: \begin{itemize}
        \item Members who reach targets early or who do well overall will be rewarded with acknowledgments of being strong contributors. \end{itemize}
    \item Consequences: \begin{itemize}
        \item First time incident will be a verbal reminder.
        \item Second time will result in a discussion with the TA.
        \item Third time and more will result in escalation to the course instructor.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Team Building}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start meetings with small talk and conversations to get to know each other and maintain team connection.
    \item Doing a group ritual of small activities like board games or lunch to celebrate milestone deliveries.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Initial plan will be to reach consensus when possible.
    \item If consensus cannot be reached, opt for a majority vote.
    \item If disagreements still exist within the team if consensus and majority vote leaves members unsatisfied, involve the TA for handling disagreements.
\end{itemize}
