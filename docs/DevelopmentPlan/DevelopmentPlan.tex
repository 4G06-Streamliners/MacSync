\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The team will meet twice a week. Once online on Monday, from 9:30pm to 10:30pm, to discuss details on work to complete during the week. The second time will be from 5:00pm to 6:30pm to discuss progress, roadblocks, or any issues where assistance is required. This meeting will be online on the weeks there are no in-person progress check-ins and in-person otherwise. \vspace{1em}

The team will meet with the industry advisor online every week on Wednesday during the 4G06 tutorial time from 4:30pm to 5:00pm. This meeting will be to discuss project updates, clear up confusion, and ask for help if needed. \vspace{1em}

Before all meetings, an agenda will be provided. The agenda will cover the main discussion points to guide the conversation in meetings. All meetings will be structured with project updates provided by all team members first, then an update on any roadblocks or issues that need to be dealt with. The end of the meeting will focus on developing a plan for next steps, assigning tasks to each member, and defining an agenda for the next meeting. At the end of the meeting, a record of the meeting minutes will be provided by the chair of the meeting to keep the team accountable for their tasks.





\section{Team Communication Plan}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Main Objectives:} The main objective of the team communication plan is to ensure the team is updated on the tasks they have to complete, the current project progress and the deadlines for completing their tasks. This is to ensure all members are accountable for the progress of the project.\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Communication Platform:} The team's main form of communication will be through Discord for quick updates, project reminders, discussions on division of labour for milestones and getting help for issues faced.\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Response Times:} Maximum 12 hours response time for any form of communication from accepting github issue assignments to message responses on Discord.\vspace{1em}

\textbf{GitHub Issue Tracking:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creation of Issues: Issues will be created for every project task, defect or feature and will be linked to the Kanban board.
    \item Issue Assignment: Issues will be assigned to team members based on interest and group consensus. 
    \item Issue Updates: Issue progress will need to be updated in the Kanban board by dragging into “In Progress” state or “Review” state.
    \item Issue Reviews and Closure: Issues will be reviewed by the team to ensure quality standards are met and will then be merged and closed after consensus is reached.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conflict Resolution:} Disagreements on responsibilities, division of tasks or ideas escalated to the entirety of the team for a vote to decide on next steps. Final escalation to project supervisor if no consensus reached.

\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Git Usage}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Github will be used as the primary version control system (VCS).
    \item All commits must be made to a non-master branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged.
    \item Branching Strategy: \begin{itemize}
    \item Main branch: Stable production-ready code waiting for a release.
    \item Documentation branches: Used to maintain and update project documentation and requirements.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{docs/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Development branch: Integration branch where all new features and bug fixes are merged. This branch will contain the latest features with the most up-to-date code. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{dev}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Feature branches: Used to develop and test new features before merging into the development branch. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{feature/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Bugfix branches: Used to fix defects.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{bugfix/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issues and Project Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Github issues will serve as the primary issue/ticket system
    \item All subsections of each document/report will have its own issue
    \item All new tasks and/or features will have its own issue
    \item Issues will be classified to using labels (e.g., \texttt{documentation}, \texttt{feature}, \texttt{bug}).
    \item Github's Kanban board will be used to monitor progress
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CI/CD Usage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using Github Actions.
    \item Continuous Integration \textbf{(CI)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Automatically build the project and run tests on every pull request.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Continuous Deployment \textbf{(CD)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Deploy staging builds after merging to development branch.
        \item Deploy production builds after merging to main branch.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

The team will adopt consistent coding standards to ensure readability, maintainability, and effective collaboration. For JavaScript code, the team will follow the \href{https://github.com/airbnb/javascript}{Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide}, which provides well-established conventions for formatting and best practices. Code formatting will be automated with \textbf{Prettier}, and linting will be enforced with \textbf{ESLint} to reduce inconsistencies across contributions.

Naming conventions will remain uniform across the stack:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{camelCase} for variables and functions
  \item \texttt{PascalCase} for React components and NestJS classes
  \item \texttt{snake\_case} for PostgreSQL tables and column names
\end{itemize}

Beyond style rules, the team will apply \textbf{Clean Code principles} to keep the codebase simple and easy to understand. This means writing small and focused functions, choosing descriptive names, avoiding duplication, and keeping modules cohesive. Comments will be added only where necessary to clarify complex logic, with the preference being self-explanatory code.

For version control, all work will be done in feature branches, with pull requests reviewed before merging into \texttt{staging} or \texttt{main}. Commit messages will follow the imperative style (for example, “Add payment processing logic”) to maintain a clear project history.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?

    Creating a development plan helped the team align on goals, expectations, and responsibilities before beginning development. Because this project spans multiple groups, documenting decisions early established a common foundation and reduced the risk of misunderstandings later. It also encouraged us to think ahead about technologies, workflows, and risks, which gave the team more confidence moving into implementation.
    
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?

    The advantages of CI/CD include automated testing, faster feedback, and reduced integration issues. It helps ensure that code changes are validated continuously, which improves reliability and makes collaboration smoother. On the other hand, the disadvantages are the upfront setup effort and the need for ongoing maintenance of pipelines. For a student project with limited time, the main challenge is balancing the investment in CI/CD with the need to deliver features quickly.
    
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
   
    The team did not have any major disagreements, but there were discussions around which ORM should be used. Some members had experience with Prisma, while others were interested in Drizzle for its modern features and close mapping to SQL. After reviewing the trade-offs together and following up with the mentors for additional guidance, the team decided to move forward with Drizzle as the preferred option. This process allowed the team to weigh different perspectives while still keeping flexibility in case future integration across groups requires adjustments.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Overall, this deliverable reinforced the importance of careful planning, open communication, and collaborative decision-making.} By documenting our expectations early, reflecting on the role of CI/CD, and carefully weighing options for the technology stack, the team not only produced a development plan but also practiced the skills needed to sustain long-term teamwork. These lessons will continue to shape how we approach challenges in the later stages of the project.
