\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

This project does not involve the use or disclosure of confidential information 
from any industry partner. All requirements, specifications, and implementation 
details have been developed by the student team. As there is no industry-provided proprietary data 
or trade secrets involved, no Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is required. 

\section{IP to Protect}

All intellectual property (IP) generated as part of this project is owned by the 
student team, in accordance with McMaster University’s policies on ownership of 
student work. Since the project is not sponsored by an external industry partner, 
no Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement form is required. To enable the 
intended use of the system, the student team will grant the McMaster Engineering 
Society a non-exclusive license to operate and maintain the software for its 
events and activities. Ownership of the underlying source code remains with the 
student developers. 

\section{Copyright License}

All software developed by the student team is protected under copyright law. 
To clarify permitted use, the team has adopted the MIT License, which is included 
in the project repository
\href{https://github.com/4G06-team12-MacSync/demo-repository/blob/main/LICENSE}{here}. 
This license allows reuse and modification of the code, provided that the 
original copyright notice and license terms are preserved. This ensures proper 
attribution to the development team.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Git Usage}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Github will be used as the primary version control system (VCS).
    \item All commits must be made to a non-master branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged.
    \item Branching Strategy: \begin{itemize}
    \item Main branch: Stable production-ready code waiting for a release.
    \item Documentation branches: Used to maintain and update project documentation and requirements.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{docs/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Development branch: Integration branch where all new features and bug fixes are merged. This branch will contain the latest features with the most up-to-date code. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{dev}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Feature branches: Used to develop and test new features before merging into the development branch. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{feature/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Bugfix branches: Used to fix defects.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{bugfix/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issues and Project Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Github issues will serve as the primary issue/ticket system
    \item All subsections of each document/report will have its own issue
    \item All new tasks and/or features will have its own issue
    \item Issues will be classified to using labels (e.g., \texttt{documentation}, \texttt{feature}, \texttt{bug}).
    \item Github's Kanban board will be used to monitor progress
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CI/CD Usage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using Github Actions.
    \item Continuous Integration \textbf{(CI)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Automatically build the project and run tests on every pull request.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Continuous Deployment \textbf{(CD)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Deploy staging builds after merging to development branch.
        \item Deploy production builds after merging to main branch.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

The team will adopt consistent coding standards to ensure readability, maintainability, and effective collaboration. For JavaScript code, the team will follow the \href{https://github.com/airbnb/javascript}{Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide}, which provides well-established conventions for formatting and best practices. Code formatting will be automated with \textbf{Prettier}, and linting will be enforced with \textbf{ESLint} to reduce inconsistencies across contributions.

Naming conventions will remain uniform across the stack:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{camelCase} for variables and functions
  \item \texttt{PascalCase} for React components and NestJS classes
  \item \texttt{snake\_case} for PostgreSQL tables and column names
\end{itemize}

Beyond style rules, the team will apply \textbf{Clean Code principles} to keep the codebase simple and easy to understand. This means writing small and focused functions, choosing descriptive names, avoiding duplication, and keeping modules cohesive. Comments will be added only where necessary to clarify complex logic, with the preference being self-explanatory code.

For version control, all work will be done in feature branches, with pull requests reviewed before merging into \texttt{staging} or \texttt{main}. Commit messages will follow the imperative style (for example, “Add payment processing logic”) to maintain a clear project history.
