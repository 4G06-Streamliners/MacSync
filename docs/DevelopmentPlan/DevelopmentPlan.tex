\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The team will meet twice a week. Once online on Monday, from 9:30pm to 10:30pm, to discuss details on work to complete during the week. The second time will be from 5:00pm to 6:30pm to discuss progress, roadblocks, or any issues where assistance is required. This meeting will be online on the weeks there are no in-person progress check-ins and in-person otherwise. \vspace{1em}

The team will meet with the industry advisor online every week on Wednesday during the 4G06 tutorial time from 4:30pm to 5:00pm. This meeting will be to discuss project updates, clear up confusion, and ask for help if needed. \vspace{1em}

Before all meetings, an agenda will be provided. The agenda will cover the main discussion points to guide the conversation in meetings. All meetings will be structured with project updates provided by all team members first, then an update on any roadblocks or issues that need to be dealt with. The end of the meeting will focus on developing a plan for next steps, assigning tasks to each member, and defining an agenda for the next meeting. At the end of the meeting, a record of the meeting minutes will be provided by the chair of the meeting to keep the team accountable for their tasks.





\section{Team Communication Plan}

\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Main Objectives:} The main objective of the team communication plan is to ensure the team is updated on the tasks they have to complete, the current project progress and the deadlines for completing their tasks. This is to ensure all members are accountable for the progress of the project.\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Communication Platform:} The team's main form of communication will be through Discord for quick updates, project reminders, discussions on division of labour for milestones and getting help for issues faced.\vspace{1em}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Git Usage}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Github will be used as the primary version control system (VCS).
    \item All commits must be made to a non-master branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged.
    \item Branching Strategy: \begin{itemize}
    \item Main branch: Stable production-ready code waiting for a release.
    \item Documentation branches: Used to maintain and update project documentation and requirements.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{docs/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Development branch: Integration branch where all new features and bug fixes are merged. This branch will contain the latest features with the most up-to-date code. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{dev}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Feature branches: Used to develop and test new features before merging into the development branch. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{feature/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}

    \item Bugfix branches: Used to fix defects.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Notation: \texttt{bugfix/SL-<Issue\#>}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Issues and Project Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Github issues will serve as the primary issue/ticket system
    \item All subsections of each document/report will have its own issue
    \item All new tasks and/or features will have its own issue
    \item Issues will be classified to using labels (e.g., \texttt{documentation}, \texttt{feature}, \texttt{bug}).
    \item Github's Kanban board will be used to monitor progress
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CI/CD Usage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using Github Actions.
    \item Continuous Integration \textbf{(CI)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Automatically build the project and run tests on every pull request.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Continuous Deployment \textbf{(CD)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Deploy staging builds after merging to development branch.
        \item Deploy production builds after merging to main branch.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item GitHub projects will act as the primary to-do list and milestone tracker.
  \item Tasks will be broken down into various issues that will be assigned to team members during sprint planning.
  \item Issues will be linked to a Kanban board that will be broken up into: \texttt{Ready} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{In Progress} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{In Review} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{Done}.
  \item Issues will be categorized under GitHub Milestones/Deliverables. Milestones will have deadlines that will aid in prioritizing issues.
  \item Milestone deadlines and deliverables provided in the course Google calendar will be the primary source for planning sprints. 
  \item The team will meet at the beginning of each week to assign new issues and monitor progress.
  \item GitHub Project link:
  \url{https://github.com/orgs/4G06-Streamliners/projects/2}
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

The primary risks of the project are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ability to seamlessly integrate the system architecture components (i.e. frontend, backend, mobile app, database, APIs etc.).
    \item The ability of end users to intuitively use all features as intended.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The proof-of-concept demonstration overcoming these risks will consist of.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A minimal but functional demo showcasing the different architecture layers working cohesively.
    \item A walkthrough showing a general end-user workflow (i.e. registering for events, paying for events, creating events, etc.).
\end{itemize}

\section{Expected Technology}

\subsubsection*{Languages \& Frameworks} 
The team will use \textbf{JavaScript} as the primary language across the stack. 
The web application will be built with \textbf{Next.js (React)}, the mobile application with \textbf{React Native}, 
and the backend will be developed using \textbf{NestJS} (chosen for its opinionated structure atop Express).

\subsubsection*{Database \& ORM} 
The database will be \textbf{PostgreSQL}, self-managed via a Docker container. 
For database access, the team is considering \textbf{Drizzle ORM} as the shared standard across groups.

\subsubsection*{Payments} 
Payments will be handled through \textbf{Stripe}, integrated using official SDKs. 
Processor-specific logic will be isolated within the backend service.

\subsubsection*{Selected Libraries (initial)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Frontend:} a React component library (e.g., Tailwind or Material UI) to accelerate UI development.
  \item \textbf{Backend:} NestJS modules for routing/validation; Stripe SDK for payments; Drizzle ORM for database access.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Custom Components Expected to Be Implemented} 
Despite the existence of some libraries, the team anticipates implementing core logic to align with project requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Feature-Based Access Control (FBAC)} with role templates and per-user overrides.
  \item \textbf{Sign-up capacity/hold logic} (e.g., bus/table/RSVP) to safely manage contention and inventory.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Dev Workflow \& Tooling}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Git} for version control; \textbf{GitHub} for repository management; \textbf{GitHub Projects} for task tracking.
  \item Production hosting will be on \textbf{DigitalOcean} (school-hosted), with Postgres running in Docker.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Testing, CI/CD, and Performance} 
The team intends to adopt a layered testing strategy:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unit tests} for backend modules (NestJS services/controllers) and React components.
  \item \textbf{Integration tests} to validate backend endpoints against a local Postgres instance.
  \item \textbf{End-to-end (E2E) tests} for critical flows such as checkout, sign-ups, and access control.
\end{itemize}
Continuous Integration will be run through \textbf{GitHub Actions}, with pipelines for linting, type-checking, running automated tests, and validating database migrations.

\section{Coding Standard}

The team will adopt consistent coding standards to ensure readability, maintainability, and effective collaboration. For JavaScript code, the team will follow the \href{https://github.com/airbnb/javascript}{Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide}, which provides well-established conventions for formatting and best practices. Code formatting will be automated with \textbf{Prettier}, and linting will be enforced with \textbf{ESLint} to reduce inconsistencies across contributions.

Naming conventions will remain uniform across the stack:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{camelCase} for variables and functions
  \item \texttt{PascalCase} for React components and NestJS classes
  \item \texttt{snake\_case} for PostgreSQL tables and column names
\end{itemize}

Beyond style rules, the team will apply \textbf{Clean Code principles} to keep the codebase simple and easy to understand. This means writing small and focused functions, choosing descriptive names, avoiding duplication, and keeping modules cohesive. Comments will be added only where necessary to clarify complex logic, with the preference being self-explanatory code.

For version control, all work will be done in feature branches, with pull requests reviewed before merging into \texttt{staging} or \texttt{main}. Commit messages will follow the imperative style (for example, “Add payment processing logic”) to maintain a clear project history.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?

    Creating a development plan helped the team align on goals, expectations, and responsibilities before beginning development. Because this project spans multiple groups, documenting decisions early established a common foundation and reduced the risk of misunderstandings later. It also encouraged us to think ahead about technologies, workflows, and risks, which gave the team more confidence moving into implementation.
    
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?

    The advantages of CI/CD include automated testing, faster feedback, and reduced integration issues. It helps ensure that code changes are validated continuously, which improves reliability and makes collaboration smoother. On the other hand, the disadvantages are the upfront setup effort and the need for ongoing maintenance of pipelines. For a student project with limited time, the main challenge is balancing the investment in CI/CD with the need to deliver features quickly.
    
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
   
    The team did not have any major disagreements, but there were discussions around which ORM should be used. Some members had experience with Prisma, while others were interested in Drizzle for its modern features and close mapping to SQL. After reviewing the trade-offs together and following up with the mentors for additional guidance, the team decided to move forward with Drizzle as the preferred option. This process allowed the team to weigh different perspectives while still keeping flexibility in case future integration across groups requires adjustments.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
\textbf{Overall, this deliverable reinforced the importance of careful planning, open communication, and collaborative decision-making.} By documenting our expectations early, reflecting on the role of CI/CD, and carefully weighing options for the technology stack, the team not only produced a development plan but also practiced the skills needed to sustain long-term teamwork. These lessons will continue to shape how we approach challenges in the later stages of the project.
