\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Goals}


\paragraph{Centralized Registration \& Ticketing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} The platform must consolidate ticket purchasing, registration, and RSVPs into one place.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} This eliminates confusion caused by scattered tools and ensures students always have access to the latest event information.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Payment Integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Provide secure and flexible payment options (Stripe, Square, PayPal).
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Enables students to pay quickly with widely used systems while reducing cash-handling risks for organizers.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Role-Based Access Control (RBAC/FBAC)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Implement granular permissions so organizers only see/manage the tools relevant to their role.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Reduces errors, ensures security, and improves efficiency in large event teams.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Bus \& Table Sign-ups}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Allow attendees to reserve buses and tables with automatic capacity tracking.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Simplifies logistics and avoids overbooking, replacing spreadsheets and manual coordination.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notifications \& Reminders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Send push notifications and reminders for registrations, updates, and cancellations.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Improves event memorability, prevents missed opportunities, and reduces no-shows.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Analytics \& Reporting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Provide organizers with real-time dashboards on sales, demographics, and waitlists.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Supports decision-making, improves resource allocation, and helps executives evaluate event success.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Attendee Experience}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Ensure the platform is mobile-first, intuitive, and accessible.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Reduces barriers to use, supports inclusivity, and maximizes student engagement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}
