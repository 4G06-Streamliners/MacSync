\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}
The McMaster Engineering Society (MES) organizes large-scale events such as Fireball Formal, Graduation Formal,
 and Pub Nights, often drawing several hundred attendees. Currently, registration, ticketing, waiver collection,
 and check-in processes are fragmented across multiple platforms (Google Forms, spreadsheets, Discord, Instagram,
 etc.). This lack of centralization increases the administrative burden on student organizers and creates a
 confusing, inconsistent experience for attendees.
\\
\\Students struggle to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Access clear, consolidated event information.
    \item Register efficiently for events and related logistics (tables, buses).
    \item Receive timely updates or reminders.
\end{itemize}
Organizers struggle to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manage ticket sales, waitlists, and attendee data in one place.
    \item Track accessibility/dietary requirements effectively.
    \item Minimize repetitive manual effort across multiple tools.
\end{itemize}
The absence of a centralized system reduces event memorability, increases missed opportunities, and 
wastes volunteer time that could be spent on event quality rather than administration.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\paragraph{Inputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Student event registrations (tickets, RSVPs, bus signups, table preferences).
    \item Waiver acknowledgements and personal details (e.g., dietary and accessibility requirements).
    \item Payment details for ticket purchases.
    \item Admin inputs for event setup (ticket types, capacities, schedules, notifications).
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Outputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confirmation of event registration and digital tickets/QR codes.
    \item Notifications and reminders about events.
    \item Waitlist updates and allocations.
    \item Admin dashboards showing ticket sales, attendee demographics, accessibility/dietary data, and financial tracking.
    \item Check-in validation at event entry points.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Stakeholders}
\paragraph{Primary Stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MES Event Attendees (students): Use the platform to register, purchase tickets, receive updates,
        and check in.
    \item MES Event Organizers/Volunteers: Use the platform to manage events, track registrations, ticket
     sales and payments, waivers, handle check-ins, and communicate with attendees.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Secondary Stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MES Executives: Oversee finances, risk management, and reporting.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Tertiary Stakeholders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sponsors and partners: Interested in gaining visibility, engagement, and smooth execution.
    \item McMaster University Administration: Indirectly involved for compliance, liability via waivers,
     and student satisfaction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Environment}
\paragraph{Hardware Environment:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Attendees: Smartphones (iOS/Android) and laptops for registration, notifications, and check-in.
    \item Organizers: Laptops/desktops for backend dashboards, mobile devices for on-site management and QR code scanning.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Software Environment:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web-based admin dashboard for event creation and analytics.
    \item Cross-platform mobile app for students (primary focus) with fallback web access.
    \item Payment integration (e.g., Stripe, Square, Paypal).
    \item Backend database to store user, event, and financial data.
\end{itemize}


\section{Goals}


\paragraph{Centralized Registration \& Ticketing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} The platform must consolidate ticket purchasing, registration, and RSVPs into one place.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} This eliminates confusion caused by scattered tools and ensures students always have access to the latest event information.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Payment Integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Provide secure and flexible payment options (Stripe, Square, PayPal).
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Enables students to pay quickly with widely used systems while reducing cash-handling risks for organizers.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Role-Based Access Control (RBAC/FBAC)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Implement granular permissions so organizers only see/manage the tools relevant to their role.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Reduces errors, ensures security, and improves efficiency in large event teams.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Bus \& Table Sign-ups}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Allow attendees to reserve buses and tables with automatic capacity tracking.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Simplifies logistics and avoids overbooking, replacing spreadsheets and manual coordination.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Notifications \& Reminders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Send push notifications and reminders for registrations, updates, and cancellations.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Improves event memorability, prevents missed opportunities, and reduces no-shows.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Analytics \& Reporting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Provide organizers with real-time dashboards on sales, demographics, and waitlists.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Supports decision-making, improves resource allocation, and helps executives evaluate event success.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Attendee Experience}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Description:} Ensure the platform is mobile-first, intuitive, and accessible.
    \item \textbf{Justification:} Reduces barriers to use, supports inclusivity, and maximizes student engagement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Personalized event recommendations based on student interests.
    \item Calendar integration (Google/Outlook/Apple).
    \item Post-event engagement features (photo gallery, feedback surveys, lost \& found updates).
    \item Sponsor visibility tools (logos, surveys, branded features).
    \item Dietary/accessibility matching algorithms for meal and seating planning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
