\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}
The McMaster Engineering Society (MES) organizes large-scale events such as Fireball Formal, Graduation Formal,
 and Pub Nights, often drawing several hundred attendees. Currently, registration, ticketing, waiver collection,
 and check-in processes are fragmented across multiple platforms (Google Forms, spreadsheets, Discord, Instagram,
 etc.). This lack of centralization increases the administrative burden on student organizers and creates a
 confusing, inconsistent experience for attendees.
\\
\\Students struggle to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Access clear, consolidated event information.
    \item Register efficiently for events and related logistics (tables, buses).
    \item Receive timely updates or reminders.
\end{itemize}
Organizers struggle to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manage ticket sales, waitlists, and attendee data in one place.
    \item Track accessibility/dietary requirements effectively.
    \item Minimize repetitive manual effort across multiple tools.
\end{itemize}
The absence of a centralized system reduces event memorability, increases missed opportunities, and 
wastes volunteer time that could be spent on event quality rather than administration.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\paragraph{Inputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Student event registrations (tickets, RSVPs, bus signups, table preferences).
    \item Waiver acknowledgements and personal details (e.g., dietary and accessibility requirements).
    \item Payment details for ticket purchases.
    \item Admin inputs for event setup (ticket types, capacities, schedules, notifications).
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Outputs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confirmation of event registration and digital tickets/QR codes.
    \item Notifications and reminders about events.
    \item Waitlist updates and allocations.
    \item Admin dashboards showing ticket sales, attendee demographics, accessibility/dietary data, and financial tracking.
    \item Check-in validation at event entry points.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Extras}

\wss{For CAS 741: State whether the project is a research project. This
designation, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\wss{For SE Capstone: List your extras.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  (The full list is on the course outline and in
Lecture 02.) Normally the number of extras will be two.  Approval of the extras
will be part of the discussion with the instructor for approving the project.
The extras, with the approval (or request) of the instructor, can be modified
over the course of the term.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
\end{enumerate}
