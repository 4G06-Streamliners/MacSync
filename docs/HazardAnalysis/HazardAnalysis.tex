\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You might trace to
requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\subsection{Data Security Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SSR-DS1 (Encryption in Transit):} The system shall use TLS 1.2 or higher to encrypt all network communications between client applications, servers, and third-party APIs.
    \item \textbf{SSR-DS2 (Encryption at Rest):} The system shall encrypt sensitive stored data (user profiles, accessibility needs, dietary restrictions, waiver records) using AES-256.
    \item \textbf{SSR-DS3 (Privacy Compliance):} The system shall comply with PIPEDA and relevant McMaster University policies regarding data collection, storage, and retention.
    \item \textbf{SSR-DS4 (Data Minimization):} The system shall only store the minimum personal data necessary for event operations (e.g., no raw payment card details).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payment Security Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SSR-PS1 (Third-Party Gateways):} All financial transactions shall be processed exclusively through secure payment providers (Stripe, Square, or PayPal). The system shall not store or transmit raw credit card details.
    \item \textbf{SSR-PS2 (Transaction Confirmation):} The system shall generate a unique transaction confirmation code for every payment, retrievable by both the attendee and the organizer.
    \item \textbf{SSR-PS3 (Audit Logging):} All financial operations (payments, refunds, chargebacks) shall be logged in an immutable audit trail accessible only to authorized financial officers.
    \item \textbf{SSR-PS4 (Duplicate Protection):} The system shall prevent duplicate payments by checking for transaction IDs before ticket issuance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Access Control Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SSR-AC1 (Role-Based Access Control):} The system shall enforce RBAC/FBAC to ensure that each organizer only has access to the features necessary for their role.
    \item \textbf{SSR-AC2 (Authentication):} The system shall integrate with McMaster University's Single Sign-On (SSO) to authenticate student attendees and organizers.
    \item \textbf{SSR-AC3 (Session Management):} The system shall automatically expire inactive sessions after 15 minutes of inactivity for admin accounts and 60 minutes for attendee accounts.
    \item \textbf{SSR-AC4 (Privilege Escalation Protection):} The system shall log and alert MES executives of any attempts at unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Reliability \& Availability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SSR-SR1 (Uptime):} The system shall maintain at least 98\% uptime during active registration and event check-in periods.
    \item \textbf{SSR-SR2 (Offline Check-in):} The system shall support offline QR code validation to allow event entry if internet connectivity is unavailable.
    \item \textbf{SSR-SR3 (Notification Redundancy):} All time-sensitive notifications (registration confirmations, event reminders) shall include retry mechanisms to ensure delivery.
    \item \textbf{SSR-SR4 (Backup \& Recovery):} The system shall automatically back up all event and registration data daily and enable recovery within 24 hours of data loss.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operational Safety Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SSR-OS1 (Waiver Enforcement):} The system shall not allow final ticket confirmation until the attendee has digitally signed the required waiver.
    \item \textbf{SSR-OS2 (Capacity Validation):} The system shall enforce real-time capacity limits for bus sign-ups, table sign-ups, and RSVP sign-ups to prevent overbooking.
    \item \textbf{SSR-OS3 (Organizer Accountability):} All organizer actions (e.g., modifying capacities, issuing refunds, editing registrations) shall be logged with a timestamp and user identifier.
    \item \textbf{SSR-OS4 (Fail-Safe Defaults):} In the event of a system error, the system shall default to denying access to sensitive data until the error is resolved.
\end{itemize}


\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
