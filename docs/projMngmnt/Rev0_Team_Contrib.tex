\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.

\section{Demo Plans}

Our Rev 0 demo will demonstrate the complete system workflow and integration of all major components. The demo will begin with user sign-up and login using MAC address authentication, followed by event selection and registration. The flow will then incorporate event table/bus sign-ups with seat selection, demonstrating how users register for events and reserve available seats, followed by transaction processing through the payment system. The demo will also highlight role-based access control by presenting different user and administrator views, including the administrator dashboard for managing events, viewing registrations, and monitoring system activity. This end-to-end demonstration will show how the system supports event registration, payments, and management within a unified platform.

The team arranges meetings almost weekly, exlcuding high workload times like exam season, to clarify objectives and align on priorities on major deliverables, with additional meetings scheduled as needed, typically in the days leading up to major deadlines. We have held a total of sixteen meetings to date. Every team member has been able to attend these meetings, even if occasionally arriving slightly late or needing to leave early.

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}
